# Howdy! 👋

My name is Scott, and I'm a Data Scientist, Consultant, and AI Researcher developing Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Statistical solutions in several industries, such as biotechnology, medical devices, and healthcare. 

I receieved my Ph.D. from the University of Michigan, where I developed new Systems Biology models to identify cancer drug candidates that target metabolism [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Hw1bieoAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). My work has been acknowledged by institutions such as the National Cancer Institute, the Department of Education, and the Arnold and Mabel Beckman Foundation, where I have earned several fellowships and scholarships to conduct independent research. 
    
Nowadays, I'm a Data Scientist at [RaLytics](https://ralytics.com/), where I'm heads down in AI R&D for a wide variety of company use-cases. Additionally, I have worked with several U.S. government, research, and private institutions as a consultant to offer insights, technical expertise, and develop new solutions on projects that catch my interests. 

**Some of my current projects include (but are not limited to):**
* Training and developing Vision-Language Models for chart reasoning and understanding 📈 
* Medical NLP development for entity identification, extraction, and summarization 📄
* Deploying statistical learning models for inferring patterns of care from claims data 🏥
* Pose estimation applications for improving athletic performance 🏃‍♀️

**Some past projects I have worked on include:**
* Leveraging LLMs for developing a personalized marketing platform 📧
* Performing data analysis and creating data pipelines for healthcare-based datasets (claims, financial, EMRs, etc) 🗂️
* Establishing DataOps and MLOps best practices for model deployment and data processing ☁️
* Vision models to identify anatomical structures during surgical procedures 😷
* Developing bioinformatics pipelines (gene set enrichment analysis, protein expression network graphs, etc) for drug discovery 💊

☕ I'm always interested in chatting, colabs, and consulting gigs. If you're in the Bay Area and want to grab a coffee or just say hi, you can reach me at my [email address](scottcampit@gmail.com) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/scottcampit/). For my writings about all things nerdy, you can check out my [blog](https://www.scottcampit.com/), which is currently undergoing some re-vamping.
