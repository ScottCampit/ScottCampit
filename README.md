# Howdy! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Scott, and I'm a Fullstack Data Scientist with a total of 7+ years developing AI/ML solutions in biotechnology, medical devices, and healthcare industries. 

I receieved my Ph.D. from the University of Michigan in 2022, where I developed statistical and machine learning models to study cancer metabolism and identify cancer drug candidates. You can find a lot of the work I have done in the pinned repos below, and the associated publications in my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Hw1bieoAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). 

While in graduate school, I worked on many exciting projects, including:
  * Early stage startup via the Sling Health Incubator, working on leveraging SOTA image segmentation algorithms to identify anaomtical structures in the surgical suite.
  * Data science consulting for several AI and biotech startups for myself and the miLEAD Consulting Group.
  * Science communication with several student-led organizations at Michigan.
    
Nowadays, work on projects related to language modeling, computer vision, and other exciting developments in AI.
