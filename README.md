# Scott Campit, Ph.D.
Cofounder and CTO [@Couro](https://www.couro.io/)

## Who am I? (short)
I'm Scott, and I'm the co-founder and tech lead at @Couro-io, where we develop AI tools that help runners enhance performance and reduce injury risk. I've worked as a Data Scientist, Developer, and AI/ML Engineer, building cool things in industries such as biotechnology, healthcare, and now sports technology. You can find me at [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/scottcampit/).

## The longer story
I received my PhD from the University of Michigan @sriram-lab, where I developed new machine learning and Systems Biology approaches to identify cancer drug candidates that target metabolism. My work has been acknowledged by institutions such as the National Cancer Institute, the Department of Education, and the Arnold and Mabel Beckman Foundation, where I have earned several fellowships and scholarships to conduct independent research. Additionally, I've published my research and code in journals such as Cancer and Metabolism.
    
After graduate school, I worked as a Data Scientist and consultant in the healthcare sector with RaLytics, where I developed AI and ML solutions in Medicare risk adjustment, healthcare payments optimization, and web accessibility. This is where I translated my research skills into actual products within a highly regulated industry, consult for large organizations such as government entities, research organizations, and private healthcare companies, and learned how to work in a DevOps team.   

Nowadays, I am a co-founder with Couro, where we support coaches, physical therapists, and athletes by developing AI tools that use training videos to generate data-driven insights. 

## My Past Projects
Some of my past projects include:
* Leveraging LLMs for developing a personalized marketing platform 📧
* Performing data analysis and creating data pipelines for healthcare-based datasets (claims, financial, EMRs, etc) 🗂️
* Establishing DataOps and MLOps best practices for model deployment and data processing ☁️
* Vision models to identify anatomical structures during surgical procedures 😷
* Developing bioinformatics pipelines (gene set enrichment analysis, protein expression network graphs, etc) for drug discovery 💊
* Training and developing Vision-Language Models for chart reasoning and understanding 📈 
* Medical NLP development for entity identification, extraction, and summarization 📄
* Deploying statistical learning models for inferring patterns of care from claims data 🏥
* Pose estimation applications for improving athletic performance 🏃‍♀️

## What next?
I'm always interested in chatting about technology, startups, starting collaborations, helping other founders and small businesses, and just getting to know cool people and what they're working on.
