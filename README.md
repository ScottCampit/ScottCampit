# Hey there! 👋

I'm Scott, and I'm a Data Scientist, Developer, and AI/ML Engineer with experience building cool things in biotechnology, healthcare, sports technology, and other industries. 

I receieved my PhD from the University of Michigan, where I developed new machine learning and Systems Biology approaches to identify cancer drug candidates that target metabolism. My work has been acknowledged by institutions such as the National Cancer Institute, the Department of Education, and the Arnold and Mabel Beckman Foundation, where I have earned several fellowships and scholarships to conduct independent research. 
    
After graduate school, I worked as a Data Scientist and consultant in the healthcare sector, where I developed AI and ML solutions in Medicare risk adjustment, healthcare payments optimization, and web accessibility. Nowadays, I work for myself as a technical consultant, providing my expertise in software development, engineering, and AI to other businesses and organizations, ranging from startups and small businesses to large enterprises. Additionally, I am a co-founder and lead technology person at Couro, where we aim to develop AI-based tools that will improve running performance, reduce injury risks, and serve coaches, athletes, medical professionals like Physical Therapists, and other passionate runners.

**Some past projects I have worked on include:**
* Leveraging LLMs for developing a personalized marketing platform 📧
* Performing data analysis and creating data pipelines for healthcare-based datasets (claims, financial, EMRs, etc) 🗂️
* Establishing DataOps and MLOps best practices for model deployment and data processing ☁️
* Vision models to identify anatomical structures during surgical procedures 😷
* Developing bioinformatics pipelines (gene set enrichment analysis, protein expression network graphs, etc) for drug discovery 💊
* Training and developing Vision-Language Models for chart reasoning and understanding 📈 
* Medical NLP development for entity identification, extraction, and summarization 📄
* Deploying statistical learning models for inferring patterns of care from claims data 🏥
* Pose estimation applications for improving athletic performance 🏃‍♀️

I'm always interested in chatting, colabs, and consulting gigs. If you're in the Bay Area and want to grab a coffee or just say hi, you can reach me at my [email address](admin@torchstack.ai) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/scottcampit/). Looking forward to it.
