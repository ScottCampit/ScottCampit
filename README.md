## Who am I? (short)
I’m currently the Head of Technology at Miraei, where we ingest, synthesize, and reason across multiple data sources to provide real-time recommendations and strategic insights into clinical trials for biopharma companies. In the past, I've held many other hats, including data scientist, AI engineer, and Chief Technology Officer, building high-impact AI/ML-powered solutions, delivering everything from research-driven prototypes to production-grade systems. You can find me at [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/scottcampit/).

## The longer story
In my undergraduate and graduate training, I was a biomedical researcher who developed AI/ML approaches for cancer drug discovery, specifically focusing on creating algorithms to identify biomarkers and drug candidates in targeted cellular populations. I won NIH/DOE grants and published original AI and biomedical research in peer-reviewed journals, including Nature Communications. More importantly, I learned how to bridge research, data, and software to build tools that unlock highly impactful insights into health. I applied the learnings from my role as a healthcare data scientist, where I optimized Medicare risk adjustment and drove operational improvements across government and provider networks. 

Today, I lead the technology initiatives at Miraei, where we are building data pipelines and agentic workflows to create real-time intelligent systems to support biopharma stakeholders. Previously, I was a co-founder and CTO of Couro, where we utilized AI and computer vision to help runners stay injury-free and train more effectively. My contributions enabled us to participate in the UC LAUNCH Accelerator Program, AWS Startup programs, and the NVIDIA Inception Accelerator Program. I am also the founder of Torchstack, an AI Studio that helps businesses build and deploy AI products from proof of concept to production. We were an AWS partner and have established partnerships with various companies across several verticals, including real estate, supply chain and logistics, biotechnology, security, and AI. Throughout my experiences, I've consistently built and leveraged automated systems and data-driven approaches to deliver products with measurable outcomes.

## My Past Projects
Some of my past projects include:
* Leveraging LLMs for developing a personalized marketing platform 📧
* Performing data analysis and creating data pipelines for healthcare-based datasets (claims, financial, EMRs, etc) 🗂️
* Establishing DataOps and MLOps best practices for AI/ML model deployment and data processing ☁️
* Building multi-agent voicebot systems for security verification and vishing auditing 📞
* Vision models to identify anatomical structures during surgical procedures 😷
* Developing bioinformatics pipelines (gene set enrichment analysis, protein expression network graphs, etc) for drug discovery 💊
* Training and developing Vision-Language Models for chart reasoning and understanding 📈 
* Pose estimation applications for improving athletic performance 🏃‍♀️

## What next?
I'm always interested in chatting about technology, startups, starting collaborations, helping other founders and small businesses, and just getting to know cool people and what they're working on.
