## Who am I? (short)
- I am a Data Scientist and Data/ML/AI/DevOps Engineer that works with companies to fully leverage their data to gain important business insights, support decision making, and optimize their go-to-market strategy.
- I bring what I've learned from my background in highly regulated industries including biotechnology and healthcare to ensure I deliver work that follows industry best practices in operational efficiency, security, compliance, while driving growth.

## The longer story
I received my PhD from the University of Michigan @sriram-lab, where I developed new machine learning and Systems Biology approaches to identify cancer drug candidates that hit key metabolic pathways. I published 8 peer-reviewed articles with associated software and led research that has earned over $100K in National Institute of Health (NIH), Department of Energy (DOE), and private grant funding.
    
I've worked in organizations that allowed me to hold many roles in technology as a data scientist and engineer, ML engineer, NLP/AI researcher, and DevOps engineer. Later in my career, I began taking on additional administrative responsibilities include consulting, fundraising, strategy planning and implementation, and managing engineering teams. I've supported clients such as Oak Ridge National Laboratory, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid, private healthcare organizations, and several startups to drive various initiatives that impact millions of peoples lives.

Currently, I am a co-founder and CTO of Couro. Our mission is to improve the lives of runners using AI, machine learning, and data. We work with professional athletes, physical therapists, coaches, biomechanists, sports scientists, and other experts in the sports industry to develop personalized running insights, based on running history, sports and clinical expert insights, and video analytics.
