### Howdy! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Scott, and I'm a Data Scientist with expertise and interests in Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, and Computer Vision. 

I receieved my Ph.D. from the University of Michigan in 2022, where I developed statistical and machine learning models to study cancer metabolism and identify cancer drug candidates. You can find a lot of the work I have done in the pinned repos below, and the associated publications in my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Hw1bieoAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). 

In graduate school, I also worked in an early stage startup leveraging segmentation algorithms to identify anaomtical structures in the surgical suite. Nowadays, I use NLP models to evaluate electronic medical records, optimize healthcare payments, and identify anomalous payments. I'm excited about applying AI to other use-cases, and enjoy working on projected related to large language models, computer vision, and generative AI.
