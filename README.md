# Howdy! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Scott, and I'm a Data Scientist, Consultant, and AI Researcher developing Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Statistical solutions in several industries, such as biotechnology, medical devices, and healthcare. 

I receieved my Ph.D. from the University of Michigan, where I developed new Systems Biology models to identify cancer drug candidates that target metabolism [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Hw1bieoAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). My work has been acknowledged by institutions such as the National Cancer Institute, the Department of Education, and the Arnold and Mabel Beckman Foundation, where I have earned several fellowships and scholarships to conduct independent research. 
    
Nowadays, I'm a Data Scientist at [RaLytics](https://ralytics.com/), where I'm heads down in AI R&D for a wide variety of company use-cases. Additionally, I have worked with several U.S. government, research, and private institutions as a consultant to offer insights, technical expertise, and develop new solutions on projects that catch my interests. 

Some of my current projects include (but are not limited to):
* Training and developing Vision-Language Models for chart reasoning and understanding.
* Medical NLP development for entity identification, extraction, and summarization.
* Deploying statistical learning models for inferring patterns of care from claims data.
* Pose estimation applications for improving athletic performance.

Some past projects I have worked on include:
* Leveraging LLMs for developing a personalized marketing platform.
* Data pipelines and data analysis for healthcare-based datasets (claims, financial, EMRs, etc).
* Vision models to identify anatomical structures during surgical procedures.
* Developing bioinformatics pipelines (gene set enrichment analysis, protein expression network graphs, etc) for drug discovery.

I'm always interested in chatting, colabs, and consulting gigs. If you're in the Bay Area and want to grab a coffee or just say hi, you can reach me at my [email address](scottcampit@gmail.com) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/scottcampit/). For my writings about all things nerdy, you can check out my [blog](https://www.scottcampit.com/), which is currently undergoing some re-vamping.
