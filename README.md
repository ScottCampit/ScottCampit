# Howdy! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Scott, and I'm a Fullstack Data Scientist with a total of 7+ years developing AI/ML healthcare technologies. 

I receieved my Ph.D. from the University of Michigan in 2022, where I developed statistical and machine learning models to study cancer metabolism and identify cancer drug candidates. You can find a lot of the work I have done in the pinned repos below, and the associated publications in my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Hw1bieoAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). 

While in graduate school, I worked on many exciting projects, including:
  * Early stage startup via the Sling Health Incubator, working on leveraging SOTA image segmentation algorithms to identify anaomtical structures in the surgical suite.
  * Data science consulting for several AI and biotech startups for myself and the miLEAD Consulting Group.
  * Science communication with several student-led organizations at Michigan.
    
Nowadays, I'm using ML, NLP, and large language models to evaluate electronic medical records, optimize healthcare payments, and identify anomalous payments. I'm excited about applying AI to other use-cases, and enjoy working on projects related to large language models, computer vision, and generative AI.
